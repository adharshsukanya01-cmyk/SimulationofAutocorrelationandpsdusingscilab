# EXPT.NO.6	SIMULATION OF AUTOCORRELATION AND PSD USING SCILAB AIM:
Write a program for Autocorrelation and PSD of signals in SCILAB and verify Wiener-Khinchin relation.

# EQUIPMENTS Needed

Computer with i3 Processor
SCI LAB

# THEORY:
The Wiener-Khinchin theorem states that the power spectral density of a wide sense stationary random process is the Fourier transform of the corresponding autocorrelation function.

# Algorithm
1.Load or Define the Signal: Input your time-domain signal.
2.Compute Autocorrelation: Calculate the autocorrelation function of the signal.
3.Compute Power Spectral Density (PSD): Estimate the PSD of the signal, either directly using a method like Welch’s periodogram or by using the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation.
4.Plot Results: Visualize the autocorrelation function and PSD.

# PROCEDURE

Refer Algorithms and write code for the experiment.
Open SCILAB in System
Type your code in New Editor
Save the file
Execute the code
If any Error, correct it in code and execute again
Verify the generated waveform using Tabulation and Model Waveform



# PROGRAM:

# OUTPUT:





# RESULT:
Thus the Autocorrelation and PSD are executed in Scilab and output is verified.
